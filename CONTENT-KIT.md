*By [TODO: AUTHOR NAME] | Last updated: [TODO: DATE]*

**Quick Summary**: Practical strategies to communicate effectively with loved ones living with dementia, reduce frustration, and strengthen connection. Based on person-centered care principles.

---

## Why Communication Changes with Dementia

Dementia damages brain areas responsible for language, memory, and processing. Result:
- Difficulty finding words
- Forgetting mid-sentence
- Misunderstanding questions
- Frustration leading to agitation

**Good news**: Adapting your communication style can dramatically improve quality of life.

---

## 10 Proven Communication Strategies

### 1. Get Their Attention First

❌ **Don't**: Start talking from another room  
✅ **Do**: Make eye contact, say their name, touch their arm gently

**Why it works**: Ensures they're focused before you speak.

---

### 2. Speak Slowly & Clearly

❌ **Don't**: "Can you please come to the kitchen so we can have lunch together?"  
✅ **Do**: "Let's eat lunch." (Pause) "Come to the kitchen."

**Tip**: Use short sentences (5-7 words max). Pause between sentences.

---

### 3. Ask One Question at a Time

❌ **Don't**: "Do you want tea or coffee, and should I make it with milk or without?"  
✅ **Do**: "Do you want tea?" (Wait for answer) "With milk?"

**Tip**: Yes/no questions are easier than open-ended ones.
