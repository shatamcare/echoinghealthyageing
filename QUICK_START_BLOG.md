# Quick Start: Format Your First Blog Post

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Your DOCX File in Microsoft Word

Choose one of your files to start with, for example:
- `Amritap_dementia_article_1_silvertalkies.docx`

### 2. Add Metadata at the Top

At the **very beginning** of your document, add these 3 lines:

```
Author: [Your Name]

Date: 2025-01-15
```

**Example**:
```

[Rest of your content...]
```

### 3. Add a Summary Paragraph

Right after the Date line, add a **summary paragraph** (1-2 sentences):

```
Date: 2025-01-10

[Main content starts here...]
```

This summary will appear in the blog list preview.

### 4. Format Your Content

Use Word's heading styles:
- **Heading 2** for main sections
- **Heading 3** for subsections
- Regular paragraphs for body text

**Example structure**:
```

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Summary paragraph

## Introduction (Heading 2)
Body text here...

## Main Section (Heading 2)

### Subsection (Heading 3)

```

2. They'll be converted automatically (but may be slow)

#### Option B: Optimize for Performance
1. Right-click the image â†’ "Save as Picture"
2. Save to `public/Images/blog/` with a descriptive name
   - Example: `dementia-communication-tips-header.jpg`
3. In Word, **replace** the image with this text:
   ```
   ![Caregiver communicating with elderly person](/Images/blog/dementia-communication-tips-header.jpg)
   ```

### 6. Save Your Changes
