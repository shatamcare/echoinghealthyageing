## 📝 How to Add a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Create a New File

Create a file in `src/blog/` with a `.md` extension:
- Example: `src/blog/communication-tips.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens (this becomes the URL)

### Step 2: Add Frontmatter

At the top of the file, add metadata between `---` markers:

```markdown
---
title: 10 Communication Tips for Dementia Caregivers
author: Dr. Priya Sharma
date: 2025-01-15
summary: Practical strategies to communicate effectively with loved ones living with dementia and strengthen connection.
tags: dementia, communication, caregiving, tips
---
```

### Step 3: Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your blog content using simple Markdown:

```markdown
Your introduction goes here...

## Main Section

Content with **bold** and *italic* text.

### Subsection

More content here.
