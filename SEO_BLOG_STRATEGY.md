# SEO Strategy for Blog Growth

## üéØ Goal: Get from 0 to 1,000+ monthly visitors in 6 months

### Why Blogs Drive Traffic

Each blog post is a **doorway** to your website. Search engines index each post separately, so:
- 1 blog post = 1 chance to rank in Google
- 20 blog posts = 20 chances to rank
- 50 blog posts = 50 chances to rank

**The compound effect:** More content ‚Üí More rankings ‚Üí More traffic ‚Üí More clients
