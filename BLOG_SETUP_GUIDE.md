## üìù Next Steps: Format Your DOCX Files

For the blog system to work correctly, each DOCX file needs to follow this structure:

### Required Format

```
[Title of Your Blog Post]

Author: [Your Name or "Echoing Healthy Ageing"]

Date: 2025-01-15

[Summary paragraph - This appears in the blog list preview]

[Rest of your content with headings, paragraphs, images...]
```

### Example

**File**: `dementia_care_communication.docx`

```

## üñºÔ∏è Handling Images

Your DOCX files contain images. Here's how to handle them:

### Option 1: Extract Images Manually (Recommended)

1. **Open each DOCX file** in Microsoft Word
2. **Right-click each image** ‚Üí Save as Picture
3. **Save to** `public/Images/blog/` with descriptive names
   - Example: `communication-tips-1.jpg`, `dementia-care-routine.jpg`
4. **In Word**, replace the image with a reference:
   ```
   ![Description of image](/Images/blog/communication-tips-1.jpg)
   ```

### Option 2: Let Images Convert Automatically

The system can handle embedded images, but they'll be converted to base64 (which increases page size). This works but isn't optimal for performance.

## üß™ Testing Your Blog

1. **Dev server is already running** at: http://localhost:8081/

2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:8081/blog

3. **You should see**:
   - All 5 blog posts displayed as cards
   - Each showing title, summary, reading time
   - Hero images (currently using default placeholders)

4. **Click a post** to view the full content

5. **If you see errors**, check the browser console (F12) for details

---

## üé® Customizing Hero Images

Each post automatically gets a hero image based on its tags. To customize:

1. **Edit** `src/lib/blog/blog.ts`
2. **Find** the `HERO_LIBRARY` object (around line 50)
3. **Add your custom images**:

```typescript
const HERO_LIBRARY: Record<string, BlogImage> = {
  default: {
    fallback: "/Images/care.jpg",
    webp: "/Images/blog/care.webp",
    alt: "Caregiver supporting an older adult",
  },
  communication: {
    fallback: "/Images/blog/communication-hero.jpg",
    webp: "/Images/blog/communication-hero.webp",
    alt: "Caregiver communicating with dementia patient",
  },
  safety: {
    fallback: "/Images/blog/safety-hero.jpg",
    webp: "/Images/blog/safety-hero.webp",
    alt: "Safe home environment for dementia care",
  },
  // Add more categories...
};
```
