Dementia is a progressive neurocognitive condition that affects memory, judgement, coordination, and the ability to respond to sensations. As the disease advances, many individuals lose voluntary control over bladder or bowel movements — a condition known as **incontinence**.  

In fact, an estimated *60–70% of people living with dementia experience urinary or fecal incontinence* at some stage.

## **Why Does Incontinence Happen in Dementia?**

As dementia progresses, the brain becomes slower in interpreting body signals. This leads to delayed actions or a complete inability to react. Common causes include:

- Delayed response to the urge to urinate or defecate  
- Difficulty recognizing the bathroom  
- Inability to communicate the need to use the toilet  
- Trouble reaching the bathroom in time  
- Reduced mobility  
- Confusion in unfamiliar environments  

Medical conditions can further contribute:

- Enlarged prostate  
- Constipation  
- Stroke-related neurological issues  
- Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis  
- Side effects of sedatives, tranquilizers, or bladder-relaxing medications  
- Urinary tract infections

## **Risk Factors That Increase Incontinence**

Several factors raise the likelihood of incontinence in dementia:

- Medications that reduce bladder awareness  
- Menopause (weakening pelvic floor muscles)  
- Prostate enlargement or surgery  
- Natural ageing of the bladder  
- Psychological trauma affecting nerve response  
- Obesity placing pressure on the bladder

## **Practical Management Tips for Caregivers**

### **1. Review Medications**
If incontinence begins after a new prescription, consult a doctor about alternatives or side-effect management.

### **2. Promote Healthy Bladder Habits**
Encourage the person to:

- Limit caffeine  
- Avoid liquids before bedtime  
- Include fiber-rich foods  
- Exercise regularly  

### **3. Use Toileting Aids**
- Pads, liners, or adult pull-ups  
- Frequent skin cleaning to prevent infections  
- Barrier creams to reduce irritation  

### **4. Improve Bathroom Accessibility**
- Keep pathways clear  
- Ensure adequate lighting  
- Make the bathroom easy to identify  
- Position the toilet close to their usual sitting or resting area  

### **5. Maintain Dignity**
Always communicate calmly and respectfully. Incontinence can be embarrassing and emotionally distressing for the person experiencing it.

Supporting a loved one through incontinence requires patience, empathy, and a few practical adjustments. With the right approach, caregivers can help maintain comfort and dignity for individuals living with dementia.
