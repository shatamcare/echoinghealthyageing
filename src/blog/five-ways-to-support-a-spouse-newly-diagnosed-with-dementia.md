When a spouse receives a dementia diagnosis, it marks the beginning of an emotionally challenging journey. Memory loss, confusion, and mood changes can be painful for both the person and their partner. However, with understanding and preparation, couples can continue to live meaningful, connected lives.

---

## **1. Accept the Diagnosis**

A diagnosis of dementia brings emotions like grief, fear, anger, or guilt. Acceptance helps caregivers:

- Reduce stress  
- Develop realistic expectations  
- Learn effective caregiving skills  
- Respond with empathy rather than frustration  

Understanding the disease — through books, therapy, or dementia counsellors — helps prepare for situations where your spouse may confuse present and past realities.

## **2. Include Your Spouse in Decisions**

Involving your partner in day-to-day choices helps maintain dignity and independence.

Examples include:

- Daily routines  
- Clothes or devices to purchase  
- Activities to plan  

However, tasks requiring judgement — such as banking, cooking alone, or driving — should be avoided for safety.

## **3. Create a Daily Routine**

Predictable routines reduce anxiety and confusion.

A good routine includes:

- Physical activity (walking, stretching, light exercise)  
- Social connection with friends and family  
- Cognitive stimulation  
- Quiet time for rest  

Home-based dementia care professionals can provide structured, enriching sessions that reduce agitation and improve mood.

## **4. Build a Support System for Yourself**

Caregiving is demanding. To sustain your emotional and physical health:

- Identify which responsibilities you can realistically manage  
- Seek help from family, friends, or professional carers  
- Join caregiver support groups (online or offline)  
- Talk openly about your stress, grief, or fears  

Communities like Alzheimer’s Society's *Talking Point* or India’s dementia caregiver networks offer guidance and shared experiences.

## **5. Look After Yourself**

You cannot provide good care if you are exhausted or emotionally overwhelmed.

Try:

- Relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, meditation)  
- Social outings  
- Short breaks or vacations  
- Positive affirmations like *“I am in control”*, *“I am at peace.”*  

With compassionate care and emotional balance, couples can continue to enjoy life even after a dementia diagnosis.
