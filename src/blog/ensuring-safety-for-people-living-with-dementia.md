Living with dementia affects not just memory but also perception, judgement, coordination, and the ability to plan ahead. These changes increase the risk of accidents, confusion, and unsafe situations — making safety an essential part of caregiving.

## **A Real-Life Example**

During a home visit, a therapist noticed a bottle of floor cleaner placed on a dining table. The person with dementia, unable to read without glasses and struggling with judgement, could easily mistake it for a beverage. Situations like this highlight why safety adaptations are crucial.

## **Why Safety Measures Are Needed**

As dementia progresses, individuals may struggle with:

- Understanding danger  
- Recognizing objects correctly  
- Finding their way inside familiar spaces  
- Making decisions  
- Reacting quickly to changes  

For these reasons, activities like driving, cooking alone, and handling finances should be discontinued.

## **Safety at Home**

Caregivers can create a safer living environment by:

### **1. Removing hazardous items**
- Knives  
- Scissors  
- Gas stoves  
- Cleaning chemicals  

### **2. Preventing wandering**
- Keep doors latched or locked safely  
- Use bell alerts or sensors if needed  

### **3. Reducing clutter**
- Clear hallways  
- Remove loose rugs  
- Ensure unobstructed pathways  

### **4. Installing support aids**
- Grab bars in bathrooms and corridors  
- Adequate lighting  
- Warning labels on dangerous areas

## **Medication Safety**

People with dementia often confuse dosage, time, or type of medication. To prevent overdosing or skipped doses:

- Keep medicines out of reach  
- Do **not** use weekly pill boxes with multiple compartments  
- Ensure family members administer medications correctly  

---

## **Safety Outside the Home**

When going out:

- Ensure the person is always accompanied  
- Provide a simple mobile phone (if they can use it)  
- Keep an ID card or address slip in their wallet  
- Use an engraved bracelet with name and address

## **Handling Money & Valuables**

Memory loss makes individuals vulnerable to:

- Misplacing money  
- Withdrawing excessive amounts  
- Being exploited

To stay safe:

- Avoid giving large sums of cash  
- Assign a joint account holder  
- Let caregivers handle bill payments and financial decisions

## **Balancing Safety With Quality of Life**

While safety is important, **over-restricting activities can harm emotional well-being**.

Encourage:

- Physical activity  
- Social interactions  
- Hobbies and meaningful routines  

Trained caregivers can create an environment that is both **safe and stimulating**, promoting dignity and inclusion.
