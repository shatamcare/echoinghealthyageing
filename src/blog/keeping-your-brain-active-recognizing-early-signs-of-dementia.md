## **Early Signs of Dementia**

Mild forgetfulness is normal with age. However, persistent changes may indicate something more serious.

Ask yourself:

- Do I forget important life events?  
- Do daily tasks feel harder?  
- Is my mood fluctuating frequently?  
- Do I avoid social situations?  
- Do I lose objects often?  
- Are conversations harder to follow?  
- Do I get confused about time or place?

If several of these apply, consider consulting a neurologist or psychiatrist.
