## PHASE 4: NAP Consistency Audit

### Verify Your NAP Across Web

**Tool**: Use Moz Local (free trial) or manually check.

**NAP Format** (use everywhere):

```
Name: Echoing Healthy Ageing
Address: [TODO: Full street address], Mumbai, Maharashtra [Postal Code], India
Phone: +91-98678-32665
Email: contact@echoinghealthyageing.com
Website: https://echoinghealthyageing.com
```

- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] Facebook page
- [ ] LinkedIn company page
- [ ] All directory listings (Practo, JustDial, etc.)
- [ ] Email signature

**Fix Any Inconsistencies**:

- Old address/phone

**Impact**: 100% NAP consistency can improve local pack rankings by 15-20%.

---

## PHASE 5: Local Content Strategy

### Create Location Pages (If Expanding)

**Future**: When serving multiple neighborhoods, create pages:

```

**Each Page Includes**:
- Neighborhood-specific intro
- "Serving [Neighborhood] families since 2012"
- Directions from local landmarks
- Testimonials from that area (if available)
- Unique schema with geo coordinates for that neighborhood

**For Now**: Focus on single Mumbai page, mention neighborhoods in body text.
